# RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation

About Rag in general - stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique that combines two powerful components: a retrieval system and a generative model. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Retrieval System: This component retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large dataset or knowledge base. It is typically based on traditional information retrieval techniques or modern dense retrieval models.

Generative Model: Once the relevant documents are retrieved, the generative model (often a transformer-based model like GPT) uses this information to generate a more accurate and contextually relevant response.

RAG models leverage the strengths of both retrieval-based and generation-based methods, allowing them to produce more informed and precise outputs, especially when dealing with complex queries or when detailed information is required.

Example Application of RAG
In an e-commerce recommendation system, RAG could be used to:

Retrieve: Pull relevant product descriptions, reviews, and specifications from a database.
Generate: Use this information to craft personalized product recommendations or answer specific customer queries in a conversational manner.
This approach ensures that the responses are not only contextually appropriate but also grounded in actual data, improving the overall user experience.
